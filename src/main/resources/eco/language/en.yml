# Here you can translate ALL the plugin messages. Possible formats:
#   - '<red>' -> red color
#   - '<bold> [<b>]' -> bold
#   - '<italic> [<i>, <em>]' -> italic
#   - '<reset>' -> reset all open colors/decorations
#   - '<click> -> please read: https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html#click
#   - '<hover> -> please read: https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html#hover
#   - '<gradient>' -> please read: https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html#gradient
#
#   You can also use the old format like '&7 for gray, &c for red, etc.'
#   Legacy hex color also supported -> '&#ffdc73 or #ffdc73'
#
#   Example, booth has exactly the same results:
#   - prefix: '<#ffdc73><bold><italic>light<reset><gray>Economy<reset> <dark_gray>●⏺<reset> <gray>'
#   - prefix: '&#ffdc73&l&olight&7Economy &8●⏺ &7'
#
prefix: '<#ffdc73><b><i>light<reset><gray>Economy<reset> <dark_gray>●⏺<reset> <gray>'
